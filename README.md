# Fleety

I gave the new IDE Fleet a try last week and really liked the default theme. Couldn't find any themes that had these exact colors yet, so I decided to make it myself.

## Credits

This theme is based on [Fleet](https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/). (Default dark-theme)

## Typography

The font I use with this theme is `JetBrainsMono Nerd Font`, which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases).

## Suggestions
